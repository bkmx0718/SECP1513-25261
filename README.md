| 1 | Assignment 1 (Vlog to UTMDigital Open Day) | Our visit to the UTMDigital Open Day was an eye-opening experience that successfully bridged the gap between our SECP1513 lectures and real-world technology applications. Seeing the university's digital infrastructure firsthand was incredibly beneficial, as it transformed abstract concepts like networking and information systems into tangible, functional reality. This activity sparked a genuine interest in IT careers among our group, making the course material much more engaging and easier to grasp than through traditional lectures alone. The UTMDigital staff were exceptionally supportive, providing us with deep insights into service delivery and digital management that we couldn't have gained from a textbook. Ultimately, this visit was a vital learning experience that provided the practical context needed to truly understand the impact of technology in a large-scale organization.
