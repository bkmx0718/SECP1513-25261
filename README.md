| 1 | Assignment 1 (Vlog to UTM Digital Open Day) | The visit to the UTM Digital Open Day was an eye-opening experience for me. Seeing UTM's digital infrastructure firsthand was incredibly beneficial for me, as it transformed abstract concepts like networking and information systems into a tangible, functional reality. Other than that, the talk also sparked my genuine interest in IT, making the course material much more engaging compared to traditional lectures. The UTM Digital staff were also exceptionally kind and supportive, providing me with deep insights into digital management that I couldn't have gained from a textbook. | In the future, I hope that there is a dedicated 'Career & Internship' corner where some technology based company can share specific skill sets or certifications they look for among the graduates as this would help them align their learning with industry requirements earlier. |
| 2 | Assignment 2 (Poster on Industry Talk 1) | After the industry talk, I realised the importance of Information Communication Technology (ICT) in driving modern industries. The talk let me understand that ICT supports major operation such as data analytics, cybersecurity, cloud migration and enterprise systems in global companies that allow them connect and running efficiently. The industry talk also let me realise that I should not only focus on academics but also enhance my soft skills so that I can become more potential than others in the future. | Overall, the industry talk session was great but it would be better if the industry talk held physically. |
